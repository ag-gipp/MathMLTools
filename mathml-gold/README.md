# MathML Tools - Gold Standard

This submodule contains tools to load, parse and manipulate our recently developed 
gold standard [MathMLBen](https://mathmlben.wmflabs.org/about). The gold standard works independently from
the core package of MathMLTools and provide pojo java classes for each entry of the gold standard. With this
submodule it is easy to use the gold standard for your own Java project.
